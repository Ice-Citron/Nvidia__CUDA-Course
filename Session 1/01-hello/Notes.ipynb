    "When you launch a CUDA kernel with the configuration `<<<1, 1>>>`, you are specifying how the kernel is distributed across the threads and blocks on the GPU. Here's what each part means:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Blocks**: The first number inside the triple angle brackets represents the number of blocks in the grid. A block is a group of threads that can cooperate by sharing data through shared memory and synchronizing their execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Threads**: The second number represents the number of threads per block. Threads are the smallest unit of execution in CUDA, and each thread executes your kernel code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For `helloGPU<<<1, 1>>>()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`1` Block**: There is only one block in the grid.\n",
    "- **`1` Thread per Block**: Each block contains only one thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "This configuration means that your kernel `helloGPU` is being executed by a single thread on the GPU. This is the simplest possible execution configuration and is typically used for very basic demonstrations or simple tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grid**: A collection of blocks.\n",
    "  - **[ Block 0 ]**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Block**: A collection of threads. Since there's only one block with one thread:\n",
    "  - **[ Thread 0 ]**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The GPU executes the kernel code in `helloGPU` exactly once, by the single thread (Thread 0) in the single block (Block 0).\n",
    "- The code inside `helloGPU()` will run on the GPU, while the rest of your program (outside the kernel) runs on the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup is very useful for learning and understanding the basics of CUDA programming, but in practical applications, you'd typically utilize many blocks and threads to leverage the parallel processing power of the GPU effectively."
