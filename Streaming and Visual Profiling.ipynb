    "- The code base contains a for-loop inside `main` for integrating the interbody forces calculated by `bodyForce` into the positions of the bodies in the system. This integration both needs to occur after `bodyForce` runs, and, needs to complete before the next call to `bodyForce`. Keep this in mind when choosing how and where to parallelize.\n",
