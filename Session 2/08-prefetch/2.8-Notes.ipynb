    "The primary difference between this updated CUDA code and the previous one lies in the addition of the following line towards the end of the `main` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "cudaMemPrefetchAsync(c, size, cudaCpuDeviceId);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Added Line\n",
    "\n",
    "This line explicitly prefetches the memory of the array `c` back to the CPU (host) after the computation on the GPU (device) is completed. The identifier `cudaCpuDeviceId` directs CUDA to move the memory to the host's address space. This ensures that when `checkElementsAre` function runs to verify the correctness of the computation, the data it needs is available on the CPU without any delay caused by on-demand page faults or data migration from GPU to CPU. This can enhance performance, especially for scenarios where the result needs to be accessed immediately by the CPU after GPU computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context and Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of CUDA's unified memory system (`cudaMallocManaged`), data can migrate between CPU and GPU based on the demands of the running kernels, which CUDA handles automatically. However, explicitly prefetching data can help reduce latencies associated with automatic migration and make the behavior of the program more predictable, especially for performance-sensitive applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This prefetching is particularly useful when the dataset is large, as it ensures that all necessary data is present in the host's memory when needed, thus avoiding runtime delays due to data transfer between GPU and CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding `cudaMemPrefetchAsync` for `c` to the host after GPU computation:\n",
    "- **Enhances efficiency**: Ensures that data is readily available on the host for immediate processing, improving the responsiveness of the application.\n",
    "- **Improves predictability**: Makes memory behavior more predictable by explicitly managing where data should be at a given time, rather than relying on CUDA's on-the-fly decisions during automatic memory management.\n",
    "- **Optimizes performance**: Can potentially optimize performance by minimizing the overhead of data migration across the PCIe bus, which would otherwise occur if data were accessed by the CPU without being prefetched.\n",
    "\n",
    "This change is subtle but can significantly influence the performance characteristics of applications, particularly those involving large data or requiring tight integration between CPU and GPU computations."
